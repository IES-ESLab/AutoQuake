## Getting Started
To get started with this project, choose the scenario that best describes your needs:

### Scenario 1: Preliminary Users (Use Only)
![For Preliminary users](images/for_normal_user.png)
If you only want to use the package without contributing to the codebase, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository and init the submodules (both HTTPS or SSH is fine)**:
   ```bash
   git clone --branch main git@github.com:IES-ESLab/AutoQuake.git
   cd AutoQuake
   ./init_submodules.sh # use sh to execute the script if powershell.
   ```
2. **Install dependecies**: Follow the installation instructions in the [Installation](#installation) section.
**Use the Package**: Follow the instructions in the Usage section to start generating earthquake catalogs.
**Report Issues**: If you encounter any problems or have suggestions for improvement, please [open or report an issue](https://github.com/IES-ESLab/AutoQuake/issues). Describe the problem in detail to help us address it quickly.
**Pull Updates**: Regularly pull updates from the original repository to keep your local copy synchronized and avoid conflicts.
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
### Scenario 2: Contributors (Recommended. Develop and Improve)
![For contributors](images/for_contributor.png)
If you’re interested in contributing to the development of this project, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository**: Visit the GitHub page of the repository and click on "Fork" to create your own copy.
2. **Clone your forked repository and init the submodules (both HTTPS or SSH is fine)**:
   ```bash
   git clone --branch dev https://github.com/your-username/AutoQuake.git # clone the dev branch
   cd AutoQuake
   ./init_submodules.sh # use sh to execute the script if powershell.
   ```
3. **Install dependecies**: Follow the installation instructions in the [Installation](#installation) section.
4. **Adding remote for original repository**: Connect your local repository to the original (upstream) repository to fetch updates.    
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/IES-ESLab/AutoQuake.git
   ```
5. **Make your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
6. **commit** them:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   ```
7. **Push your changes** to your forked repository when you're ready to share your work:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
**Pull Updates**: Regularly pull updates from the original repository to keep your local copy synchronized and avoid conflicts.
   ```bash
   git pull upstream main
   ```
**Open a Pull Request**: Once your changes are pushed, go to the original repository on GitHub and open a Pull Request from your branch to the dev branch of the main repository.

## Installation
This package supports both `requirements.txt` and `env.yml` for dependency management. Choose one of the following installation methods:    

### 1. Using Conda (`env.yml`)
If you’re using Conda, create a new environment directly from the provided `env.yml` file:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f env.yml
   conda activate AutoQuake_v0
   ```
   
### 2. Using pip (`requirements.txt`)
To install dependencies using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### 3. Configurations with `pyproject.toml`
The `pyproject.toml` file contains configuration settings, including code linting rules (using `ruff`) and project metadata. To apply these settings, make sure to install `ruff`:
   ```bash
   pip install ruff
   ```
## Dataset Structure (Different data format in different data directory)
**Important**: For the package to function correctly, the dataset must follow a specific directory structure. Ensure your data is organized as follows:    
For seismometer:    
   ```bash
   /dataset_parent_dir/
    ├── \*YYYYMMDD\*/         # data folder should contain the Year-Month-Day format for glob. 
    │   └── waveform.SAC      # Waveform data in SAC format
   ```
For DAS:    
   ```bash
   /dataset_parent_dir/
    ├── \*YYYYMMDD\*/          
    │   └── MiDAS_20240402_86100_86400.h5      # Waveform data in h5 format
   ```
<!-- ## Usage
This package includes a Sphinx-generated documentation site and a Jupyter Notebook for a step-by-step guideline.     
###  Documentation
The documentation includes:
- **Installation and Setup Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for setting up and using the package.
- **API Reference**: Detailed explanations of each class, method, and function.
- **Workflow Examples**: Usage examples demonstrating how to generate an earthquake catalog from start to finish.

To build the Sphinx documentation locally, run:
```bash
cd docs
make html
```
The documentation will be generated in `docs/_build/html` and can be opened in a browser.
## Contributing
We encourage developers to contribute to this project. Here’s a quick guide:

1. **Fork the repository** and **clone your fork** (recommended to work with the dev branch).
2. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix.
3. **Make changes** and **commit** them.
4. **Push to your branch** and **open a Pull Request** to the `dev` branch. -->
## Roadmap
Here are the planned future improvements for this project:

-  **Interactive Visualization**: Add interactive tools for visualizing and analyzing earthquake catalogs.
-  **Enhanced Validation**: Improved data validation checks to ensure datasets are correctly formatted and complete.
-  **Performance Optimization**: Memory and performance enhancements to better handle large datasets.
-  **Additional Data Format Support**: Add compatibility for other seismic data formats.
-  **Refactoring Fortrans into Python**: Replace existing Fortran code with Python implementations for better maintainability and compatibility.
