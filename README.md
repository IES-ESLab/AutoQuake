## Getting Started
To get started with this project, choose the scenario that best describes your needs:

### ðŸš€ Quick Demo (Try the Demo Notebook)
Want to quickly explore AutoQuake without any setup? You have two options:

**Option 1: GitHub Codespace (Recommended for Quick Testing)**

1. Click the green "Code" button â†’ "Codespaces" â†’ "Create codespace on main"
2. Once the codespace loads, open `demo_autoquake.ipynb` and start exploring!

**Option 2: Clone and Run Locally**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IES-ESLab/AutoQuake.git
cd AutoQuake
# Follow installation steps below, then open demo_autoquake.ipynb
```

### Scenario 1: Preliminary Users (Use Only)
![For Preliminary users](images/for_normal_user.png)
If you only want to use the package without contributing to the codebase, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository and init the submodules (both HTTPS or SSH is fine)**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:IES-ESLab/AutoQuake.git
   cd AutoQuake
   ./init_submodules.sh # use sh to execute the script if powershell.
   ```
2. **Install dependecies**: Follow the installation instructions in the [Installation](#installation) section.       
**Use the Package**: Follow the instructions in the Usage section to start generating earthquake catalogs.       
**Report Issues**: If you encounter any problems or have suggestions for improvement, please [open or report an issue](https://github.com/IES-ESLab/AutoQuake/issues). Describe the problem in detail to help us address it quickly.        
**Pull Updates**: Regularly pull updates from the original repository to keep your local copy synchronized and avoid conflicts.
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
### Scenario 2: Contributors (Recommended. Develop and Improve)
![For contributors](images/for_contributor.png)
If youâ€™re interested in contributing to the development of this project, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository**: Visit the GitHub page of the repository and click on "Fork" to create your own copy.
2. **Clone your forked repository and init the submodules (both HTTPS or SSH is fine)**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AutoQuake.git # clone the dev branch
   cd AutoQuake
   ./init_submodules.sh # use sh to execute the script if powershell.
   ```
3. **Install dependecies**: Follow the installation instructions in the [Installation](#installation) section.
4. **Adding remote for original repository**: Connect your local repository to the original (upstream) repository to fetch updates.    
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/IES-ESLab/AutoQuake.git
   ```
5. **Make your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
6. **commit** them:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   ```
7. **Push your changes** when you want to update the remote repo on GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
**Pull Updates**: Regularly pull updates from the original repository to keep your local copy synchronized and avoid conflicts.
   ```bash
   git pull upstream main
   ```
**Open a Pull Request**: Once your changes are pushed, go to the original repository on GitHub and open a Pull Request from your branch to the dev branch of the main repository.
Read to our [Contributing](#contributing) section for more details on how to contribute to this project.       
**Report Issues**: You can help resolving the issues.

## Installation
This package supports both `requirements.txt` and `env.yml` for dependency management. Choose one of the following installation methods:    

### 1. Using Conda (`env.yml`, recommended)
If youâ€™re using Conda, create a new environment directly from the provided `env.yml` file:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f env.yml
   conda activate AutoQuake_v0
   ```
   
### 2. Using pip (`requirements.txt`)
To install dependencies using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset Structure (Different data format in different data directory)
**Important**: For the package to function correctly, the dataset must follow a specific directory structure. Ensure your data is organized as follows:    
For seismometer:    
   ```bash
   /data_parent_dir/
    â”œâ”€â”€ \*YYYYMMDD\*/         # data folder should contain the Year-Month-Day format for glob. 
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ waveform.SAC      # Waveform data in SAC format
   ```
For DAS:    
   ```bash
   /datat_parent_dir/
    â”œâ”€â”€ \*YYYYMMDD\*/          
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ MiDAS_20240402_86100_86400.h5      # Waveform data in h5 format
   ```
<!-- ## Usage
This package includes a Sphinx-generated documentation site and a Jupyter Notebook for a step-by-step guideline.     
###  Documentation
The documentation includes:
- **Installation and Setup Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for setting up and using the package.
- **API Reference**: Detailed explanations of each class, method, and function.
- **Workflow Examples**: Usage examples demonstrating how to generate an earthquake catalog from start to finish.

To build the Sphinx documentation locally, run:
```bash
cd docs
make html
```
The documentation will be generated in `docs/_build/html` and can be opened in a browser.
## Contributing
We encourage developers to contribute to this project. Hereâ€™s a quick guide:

1. **Fork the repository** and **clone your fork** (recommended to work with the dev branch).
2. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix.
